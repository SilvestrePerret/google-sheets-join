# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start for New Sessions

**Before starting any work, read these files in order:**

1. **`pair-programming.md`** - Our workflow process for story-driven development
2. **`project_plan_{some_extension}.md`** - Current progress and next story to work on  
3. **`technical_considerations.md`** - Lessons learned and implementation decisions
4. **`google-sheets-join-architecture.md`** - Overall architecture and design decisions

**Key workflow reminders:**
- Always use the TodoWrite tool to track story progress
- Follow the exact human verification format from pair-programming.md
- Update technical_considerations.md with lessons learned after each story
